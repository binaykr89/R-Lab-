Dear All,
This is 16th program solution for B1 batch of the BigData R lab.

Already airquality is installed package in your R studio.
You can check this by the command, head(airquality).
If this is not found, you have to install package by using installPackages option of the Tools menu.
Rest of the lines are as below
============================================
localData=airquality   # get the dataset into localdata
head(localData)  # shows main data components
 
#problem a.Display the dimension of the dataset
 
dim(localData)
 
#  b.Display the class of each fields in the data set
 lapply(localData, class) # will display all datatypes
#$Ozone  …
 
#  c.  Test the missing values
 is.na(localData)
 
# d. Recode the missing values, as mean of the column values
# replacing NA values with mean of the Ozone data is as below
localData$Ozone[is.na(localData$Ozone)]= mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

# you can do the above for other categories of data like Temperature as well
 
# problem e. Exclude the missing values
 
x=na.omit(localData)
x  #here x has no NA values
